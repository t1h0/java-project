My final submission to the java course during my master's studies. General functionality was given but expanded by me.

## Setup

### Get Started

1. Install / download the requirements.
2. Start the project with `de.tilmanhornung.java.App` as the entry point.

## Features

* Draw points on the screen and add geometrical shapes (lines, rectangles, circles) by clicking on two already drawn points.
* Shapes can be filled (check 'Fill') and different colors can be chosen for every entity drawn onto the screen.
* Show intersections of all entities by hitting the respective button.
* Load or save the drawn points with the bottom buttons.
* Clear the screen by hitting the respective button.
